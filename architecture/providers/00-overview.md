# 00 — Overview: Moving the Real-Data Boundary

## Why this track exists

Everything real in Aetherloom today runs inside the demo world: the full pipeline (availability → scan → reconcile → plan → gate → preview → approve → execute → journal) over `FakeStorageProvider`s and in-memory stores. That was the plan — harden the engine before any real integration exists. This track is the payoff: implement `StorageProvider` ✅ ([../core/02-provider-abstraction.md](../core/02-provider-abstraction.md)) against real backends and compose them into a `WorkspaceEngineSession` 🆕 behind the seam the UI already proved ([../ui/03-engine-session.md](../ui/03-engine-session.md)).

The strategic choice, restated from the development order in `CLAUDE.md`: **local folders first, then NAS, then iCloud Drive, then cloud APIs.** A local↔local sync exercises 100 % of the real pipeline — staging, journal, preconditions, trash, recovery — with the fewest new failure modes. iCloud Drive is then a small, well-contained delta (placeholder semantics on top of a filesystem provider) instead of the place where filesystem bugs and placeholder bugs are discovered simultaneously.

## 1. Milestones

| # | Milestone | Outcome | Where designed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Provider conformance suite 🆕 | One reusable test suite any `StorageProvider` must pass; the fakes pass it first, proving the harness | §3 below |
| M2 | Local provider, read side 🆕 | Truthful availability and scanning of real directories; zero mutations | [local/00-overview.md](local/00-overview.md) |
| M3 | Local provider, mutations 🆕 | Atomic stores, relocate, trash; full conformance passage | [local/](local/README.md) (planned docs) |
| M4 | `WorkspaceEngineSession` 🆕 | **First real sync**: two local folders, file-backed stores, `NSOpenPanel` scopes, persistence across relaunch | 01-workspace-session.md ⏭ |
| M5 | NAS hardening 🆕 | Timeout-bounded enumeration, `volumeUnreachable`/`volumeNotMounted` fidelity, quarantine trash | [local/](local/README.md) (planned docs) |
| M6 | iCloud Drive variant ⏭ | Dataless placeholders observed (`isPlaceholder`, never absent), materialization before fetch | icloud/ ⏭ |
| — | SQLite, FSEvents hints, cloud APIs ⏭ | Deferred; interfaces already stable ([../core/09-persistence.md §4](../core/09-persistence.md)) | later |

M1→M4 are strictly serial. M5 overlaps M4 freely (disjoint files). Each milestone ends with the full suite green.

## 2. Shared normative requirements

Every real provider, current and future, obeys these — they extend the normative behavior in [../core/02-provider-abstraction.md §2](../core/02-provider-abstraction.md):

1. **Failure never masquerades as emptiness.** A `.complete` snapshot with zero observations is legal only after positively verifying the scope exists and is empty. Any enumeration error, timeout, or doubt produces `.incomplete` or `unavailable` — never a smaller `.complete`.
2. **Everything that can hang has a deadline.** Availability probes and scans run under injected timeouts; a hang maps to `volumeUnreachable` (or backend-appropriate reason), not to a stuck run.
3. **No permanent-delete call exists in any implementation**, including private helpers. Trash uses the platform facility; backends without reliable trash quarantine to `/.aetherloom/trash/…` per [../core/02-provider-abstraction.md §4](../core/02-provider-abstraction.md).
4. **`notFound` requires positively confirmed absence at a healthy backend** ([../core/02-provider-abstraction.md §6](../core/02-provider-abstraction.md)); when the backend can't answer, throw `unavailable`.
5. **Capabilities honesty.** Declare a capability only when the backend proves it; `nil`/`false` defaults degrade toward preservation (more conflict copies, more collision detection — never more deletion).
6. **Side effects only through the protocol.** No provider writes outside the scope it was given, except its own quarantine directory under the location root and staging URLs handed to it by the executor.
7. **Conformance passage is a merge gate.** No provider is composed into an orchestrator — even experimentally — before it passes the suite at its declared capabilities.

## 3. The conformance suite

The engine's contract with providers is currently enforced only against the fakes (`ProviderContractTests` ✅). M1 extracts that contract into a **parameterized conformance suite** that runs identically against any implementation, so "the fake passes and the real provider passes" is one property, not two test files drifting apart.

Shape (final signatures belong to the implementation task):

```swift
/// One per backend. Lives in test support; production code never sees it.
public protocol ProviderConformanceHarness: Sendable {
    var declaredCapabilities: ProviderCapabilities { get }
    /// A fresh provider over a fresh, isolated world seeded with these items.
    func makeProvider(seeded: [ConformanceSeedItem]) async throws -> any StorageProvider
    /// A provider currently unavailable for this reason, or nil when the
    /// backend cannot reproduce the reason in tests (case is skipped and reported).
    func makeUnavailableProvider(reason: LocationUnavailabilityReason) async throws -> (any StorageProvider)?
}
```

Case groups, with assertions branching on `declaredCapabilities` — a provider must be *exactly* as good as it claims:

- **Truthfulness** — empty scope scans `.complete` and empty; every scriptable unavailability reason yields `unavailable`, never an empty `.complete`; enumeration failure yields `.incomplete`.
- **Scan fidelity** — Unicode names (NFC/NFD), zero-byte files, empty folders, deep nesting, symlinks observed as `ItemKind.symlink`; observations round-trip through `currentState`.
- **Mutation contract** — `store` with `.neverOverwrite` throws `itemAlreadyExists` on an existing path; `.ifVersionMatches` throws `preconditionFailed` on drift; `relocate` preserves content and identity per capabilities; `makeFolder` on an existing path throws.
- **Preservation** — after `trash`, content is recoverable (native trash or quarantine) and the item no longer appears in a scan; nothing in the API can permanently destroy content.
- **Degradation honesty** — `hasContentHashes == false` ⇒ observations carry no hash; `hasStableItemIDs == false` ⇒ no `itemID`; `supportsVersionCheckedStore == false` ⇒ the emulated path still enforces preconditions through `currentState`.

The suite runs against `FakeStorageProvider` in at least two capability configurations (full fidelity; degraded hashes) from day one. Real backends add a harness, not new test logic.

## 4. Targets and layering

- Filesystem-backed providers (local, NAS, the iCloud variant) live **inside `AetherloomCore`** under `Providers/Local/` — they import Foundation only, and core already touches the filesystem through the file-backed stores. Core's "no network/ML/SQLite imports" rule is untouched.
- Each future cloud provider gets **its own target** (precedent: `AetherloomIntelligence` isolates the only ML import). Core never imports an SDK.
- `WorkspaceEngineSession` lives in `AetherloomBridge` next to `DemoEngineSession`, behind the same `EngineSession` protocol ([../ui/03-engine-session.md §1](../ui/03-engine-session.md)). The app picks the session at launch; screens are indifferent.
- The engine composes providers through `StorageProvider` + capabilities only. `ProviderKind` ✅ selects which implementation to construct and which glyph to draw — nothing else.

## 5. Test discipline for real backends

- Every filesystem test creates its own temporary directory root and removes it; a test that writes outside its root is a review-blocking defect.
- Unavailability states (unmounted volume, unreachable mount, missing scope) are produced through the provider's injected volume-inspection seam — never by requiring real hardware states.
- Opt-in tests against a real external disk or SMB share exist for manual verification only: environment-gated (`AETHERLOOM_REAL_MOUNT_TESTS=1`), read-mostly, never against a folder the user did not create for the test, and never in CI defaults.
- Timeout behavior is tested with injected deadlines/clocks, not real sleeps.

## 6. Decisions & rejected alternatives (ADR summary)

| Decision | Chosen | Rejected, and why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First real backend | Local↔local folders | iCloud-first — user-visible sooner, but stacks placeholder semantics on top of unproven filesystem code; local-first makes iCloud a small delta |
| NAS shape | Same `LocalFolderStorageProvider`, different availability probing + capabilities | A separate NAS provider class — duplicates every filesystem code path to vary only probing, timeouts, and trash strategy |
| Contract enforcement | One parameterized conformance suite, fakes pass it first | Per-provider bespoke test files — the contract drifts, and "the real provider is held to the fake's standard" stops being checkable |
| Persistence for first real sync | Existing JSON file stores ✅ | SQLite now — roadmap step 10, but the store protocols are stable and JSON carries realistic workloads; do it when scale demands, behind unchanged interfaces |
| Filesystem provider home | Inside `AetherloomCore` (Foundation only) | Separate package target — isolation without benefit; core already does file I/O in stores, and the split would force public surface area for no consumer |
| Testability of volume states | Injected volume-inspection seam | Mocking `FileManager` wholesale — enormous surface, and the dangerous logic (mounted? reachable? scope exists?) is exactly the small part worth seaming |
| Change detection | Full scans; `hasChangeHints == false` | FSEvents now — an optimization with real complexity (event coalescing, drops); correctness never depends on it, so it waits until real syncs prove slow |
